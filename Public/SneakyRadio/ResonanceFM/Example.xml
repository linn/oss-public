			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The circumstances in which I first heard the legend of the golden pig were oddly similar to those of the Sermon on the Mount. Crushed in a multitude, I followed a beardy man up on to a hillock, and sat down and listened to him speak… well, more or less. There were two or three of us, rather than a heaving mass of humanity, it was a flat field, not a hillock, and we did not listen to a beardy man speaking to us directly but to the disembodied voice of a woman, broadcast from a radio set perched on the back of a farmer’s cart. The voice belonged to the Woman Of Twigs, the radio set was pneumatic, and the cart belonged to mad Old Farmer Frack. It was his field we gathered in, and it was partially flooded.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/bebouchard/395300487/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/134/395300487_888ac1a4bb_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160" /></a></p>
<p>There was no sign of the horse we assumed must have pulled the cart into the middle of the field. Old Farmer Frack only had one horse, named Desmond, so it was likely he had led it off along the lane to the fruit and nut market. It seemed he planned to leave the cart in the field for some time, for its wheels had been removed. I had seen the cart before, so I knew that they were the big wheels of Motown, to where, at a guess, they were being returned. There were wheels within wheels, too, and it had to be assumed they were also bound for Motown.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dobson wrote extensively during the period when he was hunkered down in a janitorium. The key pamphlets from this time were collected in a compendium and published as a thick paperback with a garish cover design suitable for sale at airport bookstalls. It is thought to be the only instance where Dobson’s name was embossed in gold. Alas, this failed to impress the reading public, and very few copies of the book were sold, although we should bear in mind that I write of a time before mass commercial aeroplane travel, so there were fewer airports, and even fewer airport bookstalls, and only a handful of customers frequenting those that did exist.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/172/452300073_54b75a6d76.jpg?v=0" alt="" width="430" height="323" /></p>
<p>One early airport bookstall worthy of note was that opened at Tantarabim Rustic Airfield by Marigold Chew’s cousin Basil Chew. Basil was a peg-legged pear-shaped man with tremendous Ruritanian moustachios, a fuddle-headed entrepreneur whose every business scheme failed. He simply had no grasp of reality, his view of the world being at once mistaken, hallucinatory, and plain wrong. If one were unkind, one would call him a blockhead. But he had charm, and winning ways, and when he twirled those fine moustachios people swooned with besotment. Thus he was able to convince a few foolhardy financiers to back his airport bookstall, where, under the delusion that aeroplanes flew at the speed of a peasant trudging along a muddy country lane and that passengers would need extremely fat books to keep them occupied.</p>

<p>Born in Tehran to prosperous Iranian and Belgian parents, Batmanghelidjh went to public school and is severely dyslexic.  She did her studies using a tape recorder instead of pen and paper, received a first class Honours degree in theatre and dramatic arts at Uni, then did a Master’s on the philosophy of counselling and psychotherapy, two years of child observation and a course in art therapy at Goldsmith’s. After four years of psychotherapy training she worked with children as a nanny, and discovered her talent.</p>
<p>Batmanghelidjh used her mortgage repayments to set up “The Place to Be”, a psychotherapy and counselling service to children in schools. It is now a national project and serves in excess of 20,000 children a year.</p>
<p>For ten years Kids Company has survived due to the support of charitable trusts and businesses, twice Camila re-mortgaged her flat for Kids Company&#8217;s lack of funding.  Camila won the Social Entrepreneur of the Year Award 2005. She has written <em>Shattered Lives: Children Who Live with Courage and Dignity</em>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Booksources&amp;isbn=1843104342" target="_blank">ISBN 1-84310-434-2</a> and other papers. She was nominated in &#8216;The Good List &#8216;06&#8242;, of exceptional people and appeared at the 2006 Conservative Party Conference and was <a class="mw-redirect" title="Woman of the year" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman_of_the_year">Woman of the year</a> &#8216;06.</p>
<p>She curated two major art exhibitions, “Shrinking Childhoods” at the Tate Modern in &#8216;05 and “Demons and Angels: Does it have to be this way?” at Shoreditch Town Hall.  Lastly as testimony to the widespread interest in her work, Camila appeared on <a title="Desert Island Discs" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Island_Discs">Desert Island Discs</a> in  October, 2006 and talks here to Fari Bradley about the company, the children and the things that make the work necessary, accompanied by one of the many that Kids Company has helped.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Film maker and esteemed music librarian Lilly Lajevardi discusses what it means to sit with Charlie Gillet four hours every week, selecting music for his BBC World music show, and to meet your business partner in the Sahara desert.</p>
<p>Lilly made her name through music entrepreneurship and elegance, mixing with corporates and high falooting businesses (e.g. Annabell’s in Mayfair), basically any business that require musical and ambient direction. Lilly was one of the first people to conceive of an in-house music service, where fitting tunes were selected for play in hotels and other venues, as bespoke music libraries for the space. For those with no time or confidence to browse the web and trawl the record store, Lilly is your consultant (pictured: filming in Qatar).</p>
<p><img src="http://www.tangierstehranfilm.org/content/281lilly.jpg" alt="" width="295" height="222" align="left" />Otherwise Lilly is a very down to earth person, working with award winning documentary film maker Kika Vliegenthart. Together they film subjects as far removed from each other as Hong Kong city lights and camels chewing quietly</p>
<p>See her website Muzai for samples of her wall projections<span style="color: #99ccff;"><strong><a href="http://www.muzai.com/" target="_blank"> Here</a></strong></span></p>
